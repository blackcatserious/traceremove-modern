# Audit Summary

## Routing
- No custom `/404` page or routing cleanup; navigation needs review.

## Content
- Core marketing pages (Services, Pricing, Case Studies, Contact, blog) are missing.
- Repository includes detailed page checklist in `TODO_PAGES.md`.
- French translations for navigation, footer, and core pages are absent; English and French content require parity.

## Localization
- Language switcher does not preserve path or anchor and lacks distinct `/fr/...` routes.
- Text strings for buttons, forms, and messages are hard-coded and need extraction to i18n files.

## UI/UX
- Components lack a shared design system and consistent animations.
- Accessibility polish needed: insufficient color contrast, missing alt text, and uneven spacing.

## SEO
- Missing meta/OG tags, sitemap, robots.txt, canonical links, and schema.org markup.
- `<html lang>`, `hreflang`, canonical URLs, and localized meta/OG tags are not configured for each locale.

## Forms
- No contact form implementation or spam protection.
- Validation messages, placeholders, and success/error states are not localized for EN/FR.

## Performance
- Asset optimization (minification, responsive images, lazy loading) not in place.
- `npm run build` terminated early; module type warnings repeated.

## Security
- `.env.example` absent and security headers not configured.

## Broken Links
- None detected after removing the `http://localhost:3000` reference from `README.md`.

## Lint Warnings
- `npm run lint` reports unused variables and missing React hook dependencies in several components.

## Plan for Next PRs
1. **routing/404** – fix routes, add localized EN/FR 404 pages, update README "Routes".
2. **content/core-pages** – build Services, Pricing (USD), Case Studies, Contact, and blog pages with EN/FR parity and a working language switcher.
3. **ui/animations** – create UI kit with lightweight animations and shared styling tokens.
4. **seo/basics** – meta/OG tags, sitemap.xml, robots.txt, canonical links, schema.org, and `hreflang` for each locale.
5. **forms/contact** – validation, localized EN/FR messages, Turnstile/hCaptcha via `.env`, mock Notion/Sheets integration, and "Thank you" pages.
6. **perf/optimize** – minify assets, responsive & lazy images, WebP/AVIF; produce `/operational/perf_report.md`.
7. **security/hardening** – `.env.example`, security headers, restrict admin access, remove leftover files.
8. **docs/deploy** – update README, add DEPLOY.md with cPanel Git deploy and ZIP build to `/build/artifacts/traceremove.zip`.
9. **qa** – verify zero broken links, localized 404 pages, and meet Lighthouse goals (Perf ≥ 85, SEO ≥ 90).
